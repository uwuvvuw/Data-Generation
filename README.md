# Data-Generation
The regular expression is considered and hardcoded into the program to create the strings required for the data sets. The random seed - srand() is made constant to ensure that Set A is a subset of Set B and Set A &amp; B both subsets of Set C (data in Set A and B are in Set C). Found data uses the same constant seed to generate while the NotFound data uses a random seed and is checked to make sure that they do not exist in the data sets.
